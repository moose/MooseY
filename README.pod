=head1 NAME

MooseY - Document the MooseY namespace

=head1 VERSION

version 0.002

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package MyClass;
    use MooseY;

    ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<MooseY::*> namespace is I<tentatively> for modules that do not simply use L<Moose>,
but are dependent on L<Moose> in some way (i.e. it would have no meaning
outside of a Moose context).  This is to set the module apart from modules
that provide I<extensions> to L<Moose>, which belong in the C<MooseX::*>
namespace.

(This documentation is a preliminary placeholder for more information. Patches
welcome!)
